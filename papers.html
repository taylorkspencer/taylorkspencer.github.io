            <div class="paragraph">The Python programming language is used by several major technology companies, and it is the most discussed programming language on the Internet.&nbsp; However, neither UNT nor any other university in Texas teaches Python.&nbsp; In this paper, I discuss the case for teaching Python, detail a possible Python course that could be taught at the University of North Texas in the future, and tell how UNT, by introducing a Python programming course, could improve the prospects of its graduates for jobs both inside and outside of Texas.</div>

          <section>
            <div class="paragraph">There have been lots of controversies involving privacy lately.&nbsp; In this paper, I look at and give a multi-faceted view of data privacy on the Internet.&nbsp; First, I examine the legal side of the issue.&nbsp; Then I try to present an idealistic view of how, in my opinion, things should be as it relates to privacy.&nbsp; Last, I reconcile this with the status quo, and see if there is anything we can do to improve our privacy.</div>

          <section>
            <div class="paragraph">Due to prominent leaders in the computer programming field being college dropouts, there has been a history of aspiring computer programmers blowing off their core courses to focus on their major-related courses, to the point where they drop out of college.&nbsp; However, I believe that these courses do not amount to a reason for dropping out.&nbsp; In this paper, I explain why a computer programmer needs technical writing and how they will use it at their job.</div>

            <div class="paragraph">As part of a Technical Procedures and Manuals class during the Spring 2015 semester, I created two brochures, one short-form and the other long-form, to promote Level 1 Construction.&nbsp; Both advise homeowners not to let damage linger and accumulate over multiple storms just because they think it is minor or to trust fly-by-night roofers that show up after a storm, but to trust Level 1 Construction to repair their storm damage to the homeowner's satisfaction.</div>

            <div class="paragraph">The last project for a Wireless Networks and Protocols class during the Fall 2014 semester involved creating an Android application for collecting the longitude and latitude information, tower ID, neighbor list, and signal strength using Android APIs.&nbsp; This report consists of an event chart for the app, which I continue to develop outside of class under the name of Networks, along with state diagrams, maps and tables (created by the app) collected from various locations in town.&nbsp; Accompanying this data is a report that details the creation and structure of the app which I continue to develop as Networks.</div>
