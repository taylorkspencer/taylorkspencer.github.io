            <div class="paragraph">Sometimes it just helps to have a visual look at your networks.&nbsp; Networks allows you to see the cellular and Wi-Fi networks around you by placing them on a map (using OpenStreetMaps), and highlighting the ones you are connected to.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Open up Networks and you can quickly see what networks you are connected to and where they are from, against your location collected from GPS or Wi-Fi.&nbsp; You can open Networks in different places and it’ll fill the map with networks from all across town.&nbsp; When you’re done, you can export this data to CSV to open it in your favorite spreadsheet program.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Networks uses and modifies code from the OSMDroid project, which is licensed under the Apache License.</div>

            <div class="paragraph">Having to manually enter a user name and password before being able to use the Internet may be an annoyance on a device that is turned on, used, and then turned off, such as a laptop.&nbsp; However, on a device that is constantly on and moving in and out of range of hotspots, such as a smartphone, this process often gets in the way of the work that needs to be done.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">This is why I created Login Assistant.&nbsp; Simply open up the app from your phone or tablet, choose “Add a Network”, enter in the name of the network and your user name and password, and hit “Save”.&nbsp; The next time you connect to that network, Login Assistant will automatically log you in, with no intervention required on your part.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Should you change your user name or password, updating it in Login Assistant is easy.&nbsp; Simply open up Login Assistant again, tap on the name of the network, replace your old user name or password with the new one, and hit “Save”.&nbsp; It’s really that easy!</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Notice: If your network requires you to do anything after logging in using the browser before you can use the Internet, Login Assistant will not work.</div>

            <div class="paragraph">Since this website is designed to draw content from a MySQL database, which does not exist on this server, it currently returns errors when viewed.&nbsp; When this website is moved off the school servers, a MySQL database may be created to fully demonstrate this project.&nbsp; This was written for a Human-Computer Interfaces class during the Fall 2014 semester.</div>
