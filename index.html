        <div class="paragraph">My name is Taylor Spencer.&nbsp; I have recently graduated from the University of North Texas with a major in Information Technology and a minor in Technical Writing.&nbsp; I have a passion for computer programming and am seeking employment in the fields of information technology and computer programming.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">I have learned many different programming languages.&nbsp; These include C, Java, C++, Objective-C, C#, x86 Assembly (DOS/Windows), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Visual Basic.&nbsp; Additionally, I have used many different devices and operating systems, including Windows 95 through 8, Ubuntu Linux 9.04 through 14.04, and Android.&nbsp; My body of experience includes writing many different programs, including two Android apps.&nbsp; Details on these can be found on the My Apps page and on my resum&#xE9;.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">I am a quick learner and can pick up programming languages and technologies in short order.&nbsp; After looking through my ePortfolio and reading my resum&#xE9;, I think you will find me a good fit for your programming position.</div>

          <div class="paragraph quote">Taylor is one of the top ten students I ever taught, in programming, especially socket programming, he is the best.&nbsp; He took the networking class with me 2 years ago and I still remember his questions, because they were really good questions and indicated how he had a good understanding of the material, he had the willing to learn more and asked advanced questions, he is a fast learner, I think now he's better than me in programming, I will highly recommend him.</div>
