          <div class="paragraph quote">Taylor is one of the top ten students I ever taught, in programming, especially socket programming, he is the best.&nbsp; He took the networking class with me 2 years ago and I still remember his questions, because they were really good questions and indicated how he had a good understanding of the material, he had the willing to learn more and asked advanced questions, he is a fast learner, I think now he's better than me in programming, I will highly recommend him.</div>
